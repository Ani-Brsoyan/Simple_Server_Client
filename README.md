##Simple Server Client Program

This code works on Linux

Open two terminals. Compile both files separately.
First run the exe for server with any port number that is accesable (for example 8080).
After that run the exe for client with IP address and port number(definitely the same as you gave to server).

Note, that if you run both files on the same computer, the IP address should be 127.0.0.1 (localhost).


Enjoy the experience!
