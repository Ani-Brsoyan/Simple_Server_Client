## Simple Server Client Program

This code works on Linux

Open two terminals. Compile both files separately.
First, run the exe for the server with any port number that is accessible (for example 8080).
After that run the exe for a client with an IP address and port number(definitely the same as you gave to the server).

Note, that if you run both files on the same computer, the IP address should be 127.0.0.1 (localhost).


Enjoy the experience!
